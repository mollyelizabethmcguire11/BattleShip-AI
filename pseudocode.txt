~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Print welcome statement 
2) Ask for game mode
	2.1) Random (r)
	2.2) Estimated Guess (e)
	2.3) Q learning (q)
3) Depending on response, launch qubsequent game mode
	3.1) If "r"
		3.1.1) Random placement of 5 ships 
		3.1.2) Display location of 5 ships in green
		3.1.3) Display each ramdom guess until all ships are located
			3.1.3.1) random guess of tiles not in in the already guessed cache
			3.1.3.2) random guess of tiles within the boundaries of the board
			3.1.3.3) random guess cannot be duplicate of previous random guess
		3.1.4) Display 1 player moves
			3.1.4.2) If hit display red 
			3.1.4.3) If miss display grey
		3.1.5) Display the number of moves taken for the computer to complete the game
	3.2) If "e"
		3.2.1) Random placement of 5 ships
		3.2.2) Display location of 5 ships in green
		3.2.3) Display each random guess until a hit
			3.2.3.1) If a hit, mark in red
				3.2.3.1.1) if a miss, mark in grey
			3.2.3.2) If a hit, check the area up
				3.2.3.2.1) If up is a hit, continue in the up pattern until a miss
			3.2.3.3) If a hit, check the area right
				3.2.3.3.1) if right is a hit, continue in the right pattern until a miss
			3.2.3.4) If a hit, check the area left
				3.2.3.4.1) if left is a hit, continue in the left pattern until a miss
			3.2.3.5) If a hit, check the area down
				3.2.3.5.1) If down is a hit, continue in the down pattern until a miss
			3.2.3.6) continue until the square one more than each extreme is a miss
			3.2.3.7) Record the toal size of the ship
			3.2.3.8) Remove the sunk battlehsip from the list of ships hunted
			3.2.3.9) Continue this process until all ships are sunk 
	3.3) If "q" 
		3.3.1) Random placement of 5 ships
		3.3.2) Display locaitkon of 5 ships in green
		3.3.3) Display each q learning guess 
			3.3.3.1) If a q learning guess is a miss, display grey
			3.3.3.2) If a q learning guess is a hit, display red

Developmental Ideas

 * If we don't have enough time to find a way to randomize the placement of the battelships,
 we can use a template that just places the 5 ships in the same spots every time.
 This shouldn't effect our outcome beacuse in all game modes, the guesses until the first 
 hit are random. Also, there is no cache of data that the AI can pull from to detect patterns
 in games played, so it would be like running a new test every time.

 * Multiple templates can be made and we can randomly choose through the list of templates, if
 we still don't get the random ship placement done correctly.

 * Each move on the board should be shown in the output for 2 seconds, and then the next board
 or win message is displayed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) check for any hits
	1.1) if theres a hit, look to the square to the left of it
		1.1.1) If the left square is a hit, look to the square to the left unt a miss or empty is recognized.
		1.1.2) if the left square is a miss, look to the square to the right. 
			1.1.2.1) if the right square is a hit, look to the square
			to the right
			1.1.2.2) if the right square is a not occupied, hit it.
			1.1.2.3) if the right square is a miss, check_vertical()
		1.1.3) if the left square is not occupied, hit it.

start at 0, 0
		0, 1\
find hits starting at 0, 0
		check right for ship. 
			if miss or x = 9, check down.

				yadda yadda   
			if hit, check right.
				if hit, check right
				if miss, continue search through the rest of the hits  
				if unknown, send blast
			if unkown, send blast


check for hits
if a hit is found, search for consecutive hits in the same row
	complete 
if consecutive horizontal hits are not found, check for consecutive vertical hits

function pseudocode
def estimate_mode(board):

#reminder, this function is called every move, so it cannot independently hold data

generate random x integer
generate random y integer
make move(randx, randy)
if spot is not occupied, 
	return hit
	store location in set
#make move check to make sure no repeats 
is this a hit?
	display hit
	did we sink a ship?
	did we win?
is this a miss?
	display miss
if res is not already occupied, 
	RETURN 	BOARD
