Developmental Ideas

 * If we don't have enough time to find a way to randomize the placement of the battelships,
 we can use a template that just places the 5 ships in the same spots every time.
 This shouldn't effect our outcome beacuse in all game modes, the guesses until the first 
 hit are random. Also, there is no cache of data that the AI can pull from to detect patterns
 in games played, so it would be like running a new test every time.

 * Multiple templates can be made and we can randomly choose through the list of templates, if
 we still don't get the random ship placement done correctly.

 * Each move on the board should be shown in the output for 2 seconds, and then the next board
 or win message is displayed.
